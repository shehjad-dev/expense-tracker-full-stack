# Expense Tracker ðŸ’¸

This is a technical assesment project for the Full Stack Software Engineer role at [Markopolo.ai](https://www.markopolo.ai/)

## Tech Stack
- Nest Js
- Rabbit MQ
- React JS
- Mongo DB

## Use in Production

- [Live url](https://exp-tracker-by-taus.vercel.app)
- [Api Docs](https://expense-tracker-full-stack-production.up.railway.app/docs/api)



## Setup In Local
- Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shehjad-dev/expense-tracker-full-stack.git
```

<details>
<summary>DATABASE</summary>

1. Create a MongoDB Atlas Account. After signing up, create a new project (e.g., name it "ExpenseTracker").

2. Create a Cluster and then create a database named - "expensesDB"

3. Inside "expensesDB" there will 2 collections - expenses, categories (no need to create manually, if they dont exist they will be added automatically from code)

4. Get Your MongoDB Connection String, that looks something like - 
```bash
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/
```

5. Replace the username, password, cluster name with your values that you can get from MONGODB Atlas dashboard.

2. Run this command in a terminal to setup rabbit mq instance through docker 
```bash
docker run -it --rm --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:4.0-management
```

3. In another terminal, go to backend folder
```bash
cd backend
```

4. Create .env file in root backend folder
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
MONGO_URI=MONGO_URI
MONGO_DB_NAME=expensesDB
RABBITMQ_URL=amqp://localhost:5672
```

5. Start Dev server in backend
```bash
npm run start:dev
```

## Things worth mentioning ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

### Recurring Expense and cron job architecture with expense schema

- Every <b>expense</b> document created by the user has a field <b>isOriginal</b>, which holds the clarity that this expense is created by the user & not by the system.

- Whenever a <b>expense</b> document is created by the user <b>(isOriginal=true)</b> where the expense is also <b>recurring(isRecurring=true)</b>, then a <b>nextRecurrenceDate</b> field is automatically calculated based on the interval and stored on the document through the presave hook on expense.schema.ts

- A cron job runs daily at midnight, that fetches all the expenses where <b>(isOriginal=true & isRecurring=true & nextRecurrenceDate is today)</b>, and then for each of those expenses a follow up recurrent expense is created and there <b>isOriginal=false and nextRecurrenceDate stays undefined</b>

- This way, a single source of truth is maintained for a recurring expense created by the user, and we maintain only that and use that only to create automated recurring payments on each interval.

<br >


<b>Example:</b> A expense document that is created by the user that is a recurring expense
```bash
{
  "name": "Medicines",
  "categoryName": "Medical",
  "amount": 200,
  "isRecurring": true,
  "recurringInterval": "daily",
  "isOriginal": true,
  "createdAt": {
    "$date": "2025-04-08T22:26:12.713Z"
  },
  "updatedAt": {
    "$date": "2025-04-08T22:29:30.162Z"
  },
  "nextRecurrenceDate": {
    "$date": "2025-04-09T22:26:12.713Z"
  },
}
```

<b>Example:</b> A expense that is created by the system (cron job) that is a recurring expense
```bash
{
  "name": "Medicines",
  "categoryName": "Medical",
  "amount": 200,
  "isRecurring": true,
  "recurringInterval": "daily",
  "isOriginal": false,
  "createdAt": {
    "$date": "2025-04-09T22:26:12.713Z"
  },
  "updatedAt": {
    "$date": "2025-04-09T22:29:30.162Z"
  },
}
```
